Got it 👍 You want a **Python project idea** that clearly demonstrates **all 4 pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism)**, with a **summary explanation**.

Here’s a compact **summary + example project**:

---

# 🐍 Python OOP Project — **Library Management System**

### 🎯 Goal

A mini project that manages books, users, and borrowing system while applying **all 4 OOP principles**.

---

## 🔹 1. Encapsulation

Meaning:** Binding data (variables) and methods together, hiding implementation details.
*In Project:**

  * Class `Book` → private attributes (`__title`, `__author`, `__available`).
  * Getter & setter methods control access to book info.

---

🔹 2. Abstraction

Meaning:** Hiding complexity and showing only essentials.
In Project:**

  * An abstract class `LibraryMember` with abstract method `borrow_book()`.
  * Subclasses (`Student`, `Teacher`) must implement their own borrow rules.

🔹 3. Inheritance

  * `Student` and `Teacher` inherit from `LibraryMember`.
  * `EBook` and `PrintedBook` inherit from `Book`.

🔹 4. Polymorphism

* **Meaning:** Same method name behaves differently depending on the object.
* **In Project:**

  * `borrow_book()` method →

    * Students can borrow **2 books max**.
    * Teachers can borrow **5 books max**.
